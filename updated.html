      <h4 class="latest">Note: When using Delicious.com and this extension, multiple tags could return as one tag. This is due to how the API returns these tags. Sometimes they're returned as double-spaced delimited, sometimes tags are single space delimited. This extension uses double-spaced delimiting for the ability to have multi-word tags. So as long as you save tags through this extension it will work in both locations. -Zach</h4>
